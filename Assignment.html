    <i><b><u>LUKE SKYWALKER:</u></b></i> <br/>
    Luke Skywalker was a Tatooine farmboy who rose from humble beginnings to become one of the 
    greatest Jedi the galaxy has ever known. Along with his friends Princess Leia and Han Solo, Luke 
    battled the evil Empire, discovered the truth of his parentage, and ended the tyranny of the Sith. A 
    generation later, the location of the famed Jedi master was one of the galaxy’s greatest mysteries. 
    Haunted by Ben Solo’s fall to evil and convinced the Jedi had to end, Luke sought exile on a distant 
    world, ignoring the galaxy’s pleas for help. But his solitude would be interrupted – and Luke 
    Skywalker had one final, momentous role to play in the struggle between good and evil</p>

    <i><b><u>HANSOLO:</u></b></i><br/>
    Han Solo, known only as Han until being given the surname Solo by chief recruitment officer Drawd 
    Munbrin, and also known as Cadet 124-329 when serving as an Imperial cadet, was a human male 
    smuggler who became a leader in the Alliance to Restore the Republic and an instrumental figure in 
    the defeat of the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. He hailed from Corellia and became a 
    smuggler in the employ of Jabba the Hutt, even completing the Kessel Run in just twelve parsecs 
    with his prized ship, the Millennium Falcon. He was the son-in-law of fallen Jedi Knight Anakin 
    Skywalker and Senator Padmé Amidala, husband of Princess Leia Organa, brother-in-law of Jedi 
    Master Luke Skywalker, father of Ben Solo, rivals and close friends with fellow smuggler Lando 
    Calrissian, and best friends with the Wookiee Chewbacca, his trusted copilot who swore a life debt 
    to the Corellian smuggler. Solo ran afoul of Jabba after ditching a shipment of spice to avoid trouble 
    with the Empire, owing the Hutt a great deal of money as a result. His fortune seemed to have 
    changed when he agreed to charter Luke Skywalker, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the droids R2-D2 and C-
    3PO to Alderaan, but he became caught up in the rebellion against the Empire and, after helping Leia 
    Organa escape from the Death Star, briefly fought in the Battle of Yavin, which allowed Skywalker to 
    destroy the superweapon. Solo fought with the Rebellion for a number of years afterward, taking 
    part in numerous operations and battles against the Empire.</p>
